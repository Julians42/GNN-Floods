Project investigating flood damage from Florida hurricanes using Graph Neural Networks

## Abstract
Hurricanes pose a large existential threat for coastal communities. Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of Atlantic tropical cyclones which places communities along the US Coast at increasing risk of damage. Accurate prediction of the damage produced by these events can be measured by insurance payouts from insurers operating privately in the region. In recent years, graph neural networks have found success in the numerical weather prediction, with some models outperforming state-of-the-art physics-based models with fractions of the computing power. These models are powerful because they can harness both the power of a machine learning algorithm to extract information from high-dimensional data, while also utilizing the graph's ability to learn spatial patterns that are particularly relevant for flood claims as water-levels and damage typically have high spatial correlation. Here, we present a novel approach to predicting storm damage as measured by insurance claims from the National Flood Insurance Program using observational weather data. Our method is trained and tested on 30 years of data at daily temporal resolution and tenth of a degree spatial resolution for the state of Florida. To our knowledge, this is the first model that uses high-dimensional weather data to predict flood insurance claim amounts using a graph network.
